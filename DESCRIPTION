Description: Provides functions for multivariate analysis with compositional data. Includes a function for doing compositional canonical correlation analysis.  This analysis requires two data matrices of compositions, which can be adequately transformed and used as entries in a specialized program for canonical correlation analysis, that is able to deal with singular covariance matrices. The methodology is described in Graffelman et al. (2017) <doi:10.1101/144584>. A function for log-ratio principal component analysis with condition number computations has been added to the package.
